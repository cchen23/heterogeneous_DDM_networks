# Heterogeneous Networks of Drift Diffusion Processes

This repository contains code to simulate and analyze networks of decision makers, where we model each decision maker as a drift diffusion process.

`DDM_util.py` contains modules for creating graphs, running simulations, plotting results, and computing discrepancies.

`notebook_samples` contains Jupyter notebooks with sample usage (and provide simulations for experiments described in the written report).

`written_report.pdf` and `slides.pdf` explain the main findings, and the proofs and simulations of this project.
